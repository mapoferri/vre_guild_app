Welcome to VRE template Tool documentation!
===========================================

This documentation extends the specifications detailed in the Deliverable 6.1 document: *"Design of computational
architecture of software modules"* (http://bit.ly/MuGD6_1) to provide a simple programming template to develop new tools
for an open-source Virtual Research Environment (`GitHub VRE <https://github.com/inab/openVRE>`_). Tools are implemented
as thin wrappers over existing software to facilitate their integration into the VRE.
